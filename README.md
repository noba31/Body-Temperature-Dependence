# Body-Temperature-Dependence
This repository has been created for the study of the significance of gender in predicting a person's body temperature and heart rate.

# Problem Statement
Consider the data stored in bodytemp-heartrate.csv, containing measurements of body temperature and heart rate for 65 male (gender = 1) and 65 female (gender = 2) subjects. Perform an appropriate analysis to determine if the males and females differ in mean body temperature and mean heart rate. Also determine if there is a linear relationship between body temperature and heart rate and if this relationship depends on gender.
